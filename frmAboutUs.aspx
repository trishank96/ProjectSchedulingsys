        This also serves, as the communication link among all participants in a project eliminating
    potential inefficiencies that otherwise might exist due to geographical separation.  In addition
    to managing all of the documentation, Project Control System also manages time reporting, quality
    assurance checklists and testing management at all stages of the development process. This also
    takes account of all the tasks, activities; resources associated with the project i.e. all those
    things, which are needed for developing a project.
